### Markdown to HTML Checkbox Conversion not Working

[GitHub Issue](https://github.com/DylanGiesberts/obsidian-table-checkboxes/issues/18)

Manually typed checkboxes `- [ ] ` might not be converted to their HTML equivalent.

Workaround:
Paste the string below in the cell you want to add the checkbox to and make sure to replace `YOUR_ID_HERE` with a random, unique number (for example increasing integers).

```html
<input type="checkbox" unchecked id="YOUR_ID_HERE">
```

### Checkboxes Show as HTML when Togelling in Preview Mode

[GitHub Issue](https://github.com/DylanGiesberts/obsidian-table-checkboxes/issues/11)

When trying to check/uncheck a checkbox in Preview Mode, the HTML code for the checkbox shows up instead of toggeling the checkbox state.

Workaround:
Open the note in Reading Mode. Checking/unchecking should work fine now.

## Installing the plugin
Now available in the plugin store!
1. Navigate to the plugins store (Settings => Community plugins -> Browse)
2. Search for 'Markdown table checkboxes'
3. Select the plugin and click Install

## How to use
- Simply enable the plugin and type a markdown checkbox inside a table. It will get converted to a HTML checkbox.
- In either live preview or view mode, (un)check the checkbox and the state will be reflected in your file.

## How it works
- Whenever a closing bracket `]` is typed to close a checkbox, it will be replaced by an HTML checkbox `<input type="checkbox" unchecked id="...">`.
- When the checkbox is clicked in the preview, the checkbox in the file is found by its ID.
- The `checked` state of the checkbox gets toggled.
